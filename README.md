Re-visiting calculator app from TOP.

Main improvements from previous version:
- Cleaner CSS
- Keyboard support. 
- Fixed overflowing text
- Fixed issue where entering another operator will clear screen
- Fixed delete button to actually delete - not clear
- Ability to change number to positive/negative

All in all it was a good practice, even though this took me a lot more time than I'd expected it to be.
